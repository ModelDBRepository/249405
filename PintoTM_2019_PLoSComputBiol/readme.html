This is the XPP model associated with the paper<p/>

Pinto TM, Schilstra MJ, Roque AC, Steuber V (2019) Binding of
Filamentous Actin to CaMKII as a Potential Mechanism for the
Regulation of Bidirectional Synaptic Plasticity by Î²CaMKII in
Cerebellar Purkinje Cells. PLOS Computational Biology<p/>

This model was contributed by TM Pinto.<p/>
To run the model start XPP with a command:<p/>
xppaut bp_simple_100min.ode <p/>
If you then select Window/zoom to zoom in (click and drag with the mouse in a region just before 100) and then run the model ( Initialconds -> Go) you should see a graph like:<p/>
